### ABSTRACT

Disasters present enormous obstacles for humanity and demand prompt and precise action. In this paper, we explore a critical intersection of disaster image classification and Explainable AI (XAI) with our proposed thresholding and automatic thresholding-based performance metric approaches. This study delves into six distinct models, evaluating their performance and shedding light on the crucial question of interpretability.  Employing our proposed thresholding and automatic thresholding-based performance metric approaches with cutting-edge XAI techniques, we present not only classification results but also intricate Class Activation Maps, providing insights into where these models focus their attention during the process of classification. We consider our thresholding and automatic thresholding-based performance metric approaches to calculate the scores of precision, recall, and F-measure to establish more reliable and trustworthy classifiers. This research aims to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of AI models deployed on disaster datasets, ultimately contributing to more effective and accountable disaster response efforts. The CAM efficiency varies from model to model due to the high intensity of the disaster dataset. Some models are good with GradCAM while some are good with ScoreCam. We use disaster datasets to validate the system efficacy and trustworthiness of a given model i.e. Vgg19, ResNet152, GoogleNet, DenseNet121, EfficientNet, and ConvNeXt along with considering Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer (Swin) with not only score of Avg. Drop, Increase Confidence, and Win but also a score of precision, recall, and F-measure.
